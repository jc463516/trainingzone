<p><em>Lecture Clash </em>training:<br>
Anyone got  a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they can be  manageable. Here are some thoughts on how to deal with it: </p>
<ul type="disc">
      <li>Realise that it's up to you.       You are responsible for making it work. </li>
      <li>Attend one lecture and get the       notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's not enough). </li>
      <li>Find a friend in the one you       miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's not on       the web. </li>
      <li>Which one do you miss? - Some       ideas to help you with that decision are: </li>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>If you miss one out of two        lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 that's 33%. </li>
        <li>Which one are you most on top        of? </li>
        <li>Which subject has the most        complete lecture notes? </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Don't ask your lecturer -       &quot;did I miss anything in the lecture?&quot; If you didn't miss       anything, there'd be no point to lectures.</li>
</ul>
